            Once upon a time in a <span class="place"></span>, there was a magical creature named <span class="creature-name"></span>. It had <span class="color"></span> wings and <span class="color-2"></span> eyes. Everyone in the village was <span class="emotion"></span> of it. One day, <span class="character"></span>, a brave villager, decided to approach the creature. To their surprise, <span class="creature-name-again"></span> wasn't dangerous at all! It just wanted <span class="number"></span> pieces of a <span class="item"></span> from the village. So, <span class="character-again"></span> offered it a beautiful <span class="item-2"></span> as a compromise. The creature was so happy, it started <span class="verb"></span>ing around the village. From that day on, the magical creature and the villagers lived <span class="adverb"></span> ever after for <span class="number-2"></span> years. The end.
