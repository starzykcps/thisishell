# Lesson 3.1: Variables & Data Types

## Objective
Learn about variables in JavaScript, how to declare them, assign values, and manipulate their content.


## What is a Variable?
- A variable acts like a box or container storing a piece of information known as its value.
- Example: 
    ```javascript
    let box;
    ```

## Naming a Variable:
- Variable names should be descriptive and relevant.
- They follow the camelCase convention (e.g., `userName`, `totalAmount`).
- Restrictions: 
    - Cannot start with a number.
    - Cannot be reserved keywords (like `let`).

## Assigning a Value:
- After declaring a variable, we can assign a value to it.
- Example: 
    ```javascript
    let box;
    box = 8;
    ```

## Data Types:
- **Numbers**: Numerical values, can be positive, negative, or decimals.
- **Strings**: Series of characters enclosed within quotation marks (either single `' '` or double `" "`).

## Operators:
- Used to perform arithmetic operations on variables.
- Basic ones include: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
